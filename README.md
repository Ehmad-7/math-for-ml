# 📐 Math for Machine Learning – AI/ML Foundations

This repository contains my **math learning notebooks**, which are the next step after mastering **NumPy and pandas** in my AI/ML Engineer journey.  
Goal: Build a strong understanding of **Linear Algebra, Probability, Statistics, and Calculus** — the core math powering Machine Learning.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Setup
- **Python 3.10+**
- **VS Code / Jupyter Notebook**
- **Git** for version control
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`

---

## 📌 Learning Path

### **1. Linear Algebra**
- Scalars, vectors, matrices, tensors  
- Matrix operations (addition, multiplication, transpose, inverse)  
- Dot product & matrix multiplication  
- Determinants & eigenvalues (basic intro)  
✅ *Mini-task*: Implement matrix multiplication manually in Python, then verify with NumPy.  

---

### **2. Probability & Statistics**
- Basics of probability (independent vs dependent events)  
- Random variables & probability distributions (normal, binomial)  
- Mean, variance, standard deviation  
- Conditional probability & Bayes’ theorem  
- Sampling & law of large numbers  
✅ *Mini-task*: Simulate 1,000+ coin tosses with NumPy & analyze using pandas + matplotlib.  

---

### **3. Calculus (for ML)**
- Functions & derivatives  
- Gradient = slope of multi-variable function  
- Gradient descent intuition for optimization  
✅ *Mini-task*: Write a simple gradient descent in Python to minimize a quadratic function.

## 🎯 Goals
- Understand the math that underpins ML algorithms.  
- Apply math concepts directly in Python with NumPy.  
- Build intuition for **linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks** (coming next).
